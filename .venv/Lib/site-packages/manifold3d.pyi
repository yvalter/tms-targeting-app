        Constructs a smooth version of the input mesh by creating tangents; this
        method will throw if you have supplied tangents with your mesh already. The
        actual triangle resolution is unchanged; use the Refine() method to
        interpolate to a higher-resolution curve.
        By default, every edge is calculated for maximum smoothness (very much
        approximately), attempting to minimize the maximum mean Curvature magnitude.
        No higher-order derivatives are considered, as the interpolation is
        independent per triangle, only sharing constraints on their boundaries.
        :param mesh: input Mesh.
        :param sharpened_edges: If desired, you can supply a vector of sharpened
        halfedges, which should in general be a small subset of all halfedges. Order
        of entries doesn't matter, as each one specifies the desired smoothness
        (between zero and one, with one the default for all unspecified halfedges)
        and the halfedge index (3 * triangle index + [0,1,2] where 0 is the edge
        between triVert 0 and 1, etc).
        :param edge_smoothness: Smoothness values associated to each halfedge defined
        in sharpened_edges. At a smoothness value of zero, a sharp crease is made. The
        smoothness is interpolated along each edge, so the specified value should be
        thought of as an average. Where exactly two sharpened edges meet at a vertex,
        their tangents are rotated to be colinear so that the sharpened edge can be
        continuous. Vertices with only one sharpened edge are completely smooth,
        allowing sharpened edges to smoothly vanish at termination. A single vertex
        can be sharpened by sharping all edges that are incident on it, allowing cones
        to be formed.

        Constructs a manifold from a set of polygons by extruding them along the
        Z-axis.
        Note that high twistDegrees with small nDivisions may cause
        self-intersection. This is not checked here and it is up to the user to
        choose the correct parameters.
        :param cross_section: A set of non-overlapping polygons to extrude.
        :param height: Z-extent of extrusion.
        :param n_divisions: Number of extra copies of the crossSection to insert into
        the shape vertically; especially useful in combination with twistDegrees to
        avoid interpolation artifacts. Default is none.
        :param twist_degrees: Amount to twist the top crossSection relative to the
        bottom, interpolated linearly for the divisions in between.
        :param scale_top: Amount to scale the top (independently in X and Y). If the
        scale is {0, 0}, a pure cone is formed with only a single vertex at the top.
        Note that scale is applied after twist.
        Default {1, 1}.
